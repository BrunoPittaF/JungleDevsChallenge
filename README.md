# Jungle Devs - React Challenge #001

Jungle Devs technical challenge of a React landing page.

## Installation

To run the project on your machine it is necessary to have the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

Use the package manager [npm](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the project in your machine.

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

## Developer mode

To run on
developer mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Create production build

To run the production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

and to run the project without installing on the machine

```bash
yarn serve
```

## Considerations

I loved the challenge, although simple, there are countless points that can be analyzed and I found it consistent with the proposed level.
